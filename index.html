      <h3 class="articles">New Contract Requires In-Person Voting</h3>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          (6/13/24) After months of negotiation with district admins, the Negotiating Committee brought back a proposed 2024-2026 collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which the Executive Committee voted to put before the membership. Newly elected Chapter President Jared Hayes presented the document to members via Zoom, on Thursday, June 13.</p>
        <p>
          Per OSEA rules, because  Chapter bylaws don't implicitly  mention online voting, we are required to perform the vote in person.  In order to give members time to review the contract and ask questions, OSEA also requires a five day waiting period after the contract presentation before a vote can occur.  </p>
        </div>             
        <div class="col-md-6"> 
        
        <p> Voting will take place at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9WNfBSZ9vXd8M2PKA">District Operations Center (DOC)</a> over two days.  Voting will be open Thursday, June 20, 3-6 pm, and again on Friday, June 28, 5-8 pm.
        </p> 
            <p>Members are invited to view the <a href="https://draftable.com/compare/KTkUmvntbEgP">side by side comparison</a> of the last agreement with the new proposed CBA.  Besides a <a href="/assets/Docs/FINAL 2024-2026 WLWV-OSEA Classified Salary Schedule.pdf"> compensation increase of 4%</a>, some changes were made to account for changes in state law, and in some cases for clarity.</p>
        <p>
         Other changes include eliminating probationary periods for new classified hires, and tweaks the payment schedule for new 12 monthers.</p>

          <p>
            The <a href="./assets/Docs/SickLeaveBankForm.pdf">Sick Leave Bank</a> is an optional resource for classified employees who have exhausted their accumlated hours of sick time.  Members donate four hours of their sick leave each year to a pool, which may be utilized by other contributors who meet criteria delineated in the <a href='contract.html#116'>Bargaining Agreement (11.6)</a> Bargaining Agreement (11.6)</p>
          <p>
            The deadline for joining the Sick Leave Bank is 9/15/23.</p>
          <p>
            If you are a ten-month employee who exceeded your paid leave but didn't have a long enough absence to qualify for the Sick Leave Bank, please reach out to secretary@osea-wlwv.  Chapter leadership want to hear from any member impacted in this way, in an effort to support them better in the future.</p>

        <h3>Para Shifts</h3>
            <p>
              Thank you to the library paraeducators who responded to our request for more information! Your help is greatly appreciated as we advocate for 6-hour library and online program paras to have the option of an additional hour. It is also helpful as we engage in discussions about the way the overall paraeducator classification and sub-classifications are handled.
              If you are a paraeducator who has not yet spoken to your supervisor about your status/schedule in the fall, we encourage you to do so before leaving for the summer.

        <h3>Welcome to the Chapter Website v.0.7</h3>
        <p>
          Thank you for guiding your browser to the new and improved...or at least improving... Chapter 102 website.  There are certainly many websites out there more fortitiously optimized for search engines and the like, but you chose the simple homespun honesty of an old-timey informational portal, like in the old days (late 90s?)!
        </p>
        <p>
          This webpage is a sort of experimental work in progress.  It should be more readable on smart phones than the last iteration, and there will be much less content concerning re-opening after lockdown (or so one would hope).
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to wander about the place.  Check out the fully navigable contract with the district, or leave a message on the forum.  There's still plenty unfinished, like the meetings archive, but work continues apace, and everything you see is subject to change.  Also, mind the holes...we're just learning Bootstrap now, and there are gaps in the layout you could lose a manatee in.
