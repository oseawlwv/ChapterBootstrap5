      <h3 class="articles">Groundskeeping MOA Passes</h3>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          (9/7/2023) Voting Members overwhelmingly supported a <a href='./assets/Docs/MOA_Groundskeeping_8-28-23.pdf'>Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)</a> to allow the District to fill vacant Maintenance positions by engaging directly with non union contractors.  With 83% of the vote affirming the agreement, the District will be free to hire private landscape contractors for additional groundskeeping until July 1, 2028.</p>
        <p>
          The text of the MOA promises no loss of Grounds staff positions in coming years, but also cites the funding clause, Article 21, of the bargaining agreement, which states the District, "does not guarantee any level of employment in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement"</p>
     
        
        <p>  
          The agreement comes after a sililiar MOA was ratified by members for

            <p>the 2022-23 school year, ostensibly to allow the district to catch up on landscaping needs which had gone unmet due to short staffing.  Workers for the contractor would be eligible to apply to the Districtafter one year, but none have to date.  Two Maintenancepositions remain unfilled, and were not posted at the time of the vote.</p>
        <p>
          The District agrees under the terms of the new MOA, to post those positions immediately and actively seek candidates. OSEA and the District are scheduled to meet in October of this year, and in Feb. '24 to "assess progress in filling the vacant positions." If those positions are still open by the February meeting, the District agrees to provide proof it is acting in good faith.</p>

        <h3>Para Shifts</h3>
            <p>
              Thank you to the library paraeducators who responded to our request for more information! Your help is greatly appreciated as we advocate for 6-hour library and online program paras to have the option of an additional hour. It is also helpful as we engage in discussions about the way the overall paraeducator classification and sub-classifications are handled.
              If you are a paraeducator who has not yet spoken to your supervisor about your status/schedule in the fall, we encourage you to do so before leaving for the summer.
